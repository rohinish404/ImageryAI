# Design decisions

## Intro Kinda

My main inspiration for building this application is InvokeAI. So, most of the logic written in this app will be sort of a minified version of invoke's logic with some stuff of my own on top. 
Main aim is to understand what optimizations invoke does over the diffusion models be it while inference or something else. And more importantly how diffusion models works. For understanding the optimizations i need to first understand how it works and maybe (not sure...) but maybe in future i'll use some metal stuff to make further optimizations (if possible?? idk??) for mac as my main device currently is mac.
All the results/ time taken i'll be sharing in this are done on my Mac M1 Pro 8gb (ya ik its less).


## Some initial observations and decisions
